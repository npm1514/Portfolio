      <h2>Hi. I'm Nick.</h2>

      <p>My web development skills have come a long way in the past 6 months. I am learning at a dramatic rate. My web training began August 2015, and I will continue to improve those skills as I progress into my career.</p>
      <p>I also started my own project based engineering business, <a href="http://www.sol-innovations.com" target="_blank">Sol Innovations</a>, in September 2015. This will act as my umbrella business for more focused subsidiaries. You can see a more extensive list of my experience on my <a ui-sref="resume">resume</a> page.</p>

      <p>On a more personal note, my biggest supporters are my loving family. Aria and my dogs inspire me to flourish and do amazing things every day.</p>

      <p>I try to keep things light and make an impact in a positive way, whether it means bringing the sunshine on a cloudy day or helping others in need. I am thankful for all that I have and appreciate every day I am given. I hope to also give back to others, so they can also live a happy and wonderful life.</p>
